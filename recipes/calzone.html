  <h1>Calzone</h1>

  <h3>Calzones are seriously underrated. Seen as inferior to the grand pizza pie, calzones are often forgotten about,
    but why? They are basically an individual pizza all wrapped up. No cheese sliding off or floppy crusts. Just pure
    deliciousness wrapped up in a pillowy dough. This recipe gives calzones their much-needed due attention.</h3>

    <strong>
      Ingredients:
    </strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 3/4 lb. pizza dough</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour, for surface</li>
    <li>1 c. pizza sauce</li>
    <li>1 c. ricotta</li>
    <li>1/2 c. pepperoni </li>
    <li>1 c. shredded mozzarella</li>
    <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>

  </ul>
  </p>

    <strong>
      Instructions:
    </strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 500° and grease two large baking sheets with cooking spray. Divide pizza dough into 4 pieces. On
      a lightly floured surface, roll one piece of dough out into an 8" circle, about ¼" thick. Spoon pizza sauce in
      middle of dough, then dot with ricotta and top with pepperoni and mozzarella.
    </li>
    <li>Gently fold dough in half, dampen seams with water and pinch together, then crimp edges all around. Repeat with
      remaining dough. Transfer to prepared baking sheets. Brush tops with oil and sprinkle with salt. Using kitchen
      scissors
      or a sharp knife, slit tops in 2 to 3 spots to create steam vents.</li>
    <li>Bake until tops are golden and filling is bubbling, 20 minutes, brushing with more oil halfway through. Let cool
      5
      minutes before cutting open.</li>
  </ol>
